## Cryptocurrency Volume Prediction using Supervised Learning
This is a Python project that predicts the cryptocurrency volume using supervised learning. The data is graphed to show the predicted volume vs the previous cryptocurrency volume.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
This project requires the following Python modules:

Matplotlib,Pandas,Scikit-learn

## Installing
Use the package manager pip to install the required modules:

pip install matplotlib pandas scikit-learn

## Usage
To use this project, simply run the crypto.py script:

python crypto.py
This will load the data, train the model, and generate the predicted vs actual volume graph.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Cryptocurrency Historical Prices dataset, which contains historical prices for various cryptocurrencies.

## Model
The supervised learning model used in this project is the Linear Regression model from the Scikit-learn library. This model is trained on the previous cryptocurrency volume data to predict the future volume.

## Graph
The graph shows the predicted volume vs the actual volume for the cryptocurrency. This graph is generated using the Matplotlib library.
